# Tumor-Detection-VGG16
Overview

This repository contains a deep learning model that detects brain tumors from MRI images using the VGG16 architecture. The model is trained on a dataset of brain MRI images and achieves high accuracy in distinguishing between images with and without tumors.

Requirements

Python 3.x
TensorFlow 2.x
Keras 2.x
OpenCV 4.x
NumPy 1.x
Matplotlib 3.x
Scikit-learn 1.x
Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Brain MRI Images for Brain Tumor Detection dataset, which can be downloaded from here.

Model

The model used in this project is a fine-tuned VGG16 architecture, which is a convolutional neural network (CNN) that is pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. The model is fine-tuned on the brain MRI dataset to detect brain tumors.
